# MimicSpawner Plugin

A plugin that allows players to instantly spawn a Mimic.

## How to Use
- Hold a **Key of Night** or **Key of Light**, depending on which type of Mimic you want to spawn.
- Use the key as if it were a consumable item to summon the Mimic instantly.
- **Note:** Using a **Key of Night** will randomly spawn either a **Corrupt Mimic** or a **Crimson Mimic**.

## Configuration
- **`RequireChest`** (Default: `true`) — Determines whether players must have at least one chest in their inventory to summon a Mimic.
- **`CooldownInSeconds`** (Default: `1`) — Sets the cooldown time (in seconds) before a player can spawn another Mimic.
