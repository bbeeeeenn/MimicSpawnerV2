# MimicSpawner Plugin

A plugin that allows players to instantly spawn a Mimic.

## How to Use
- Hold a **Key of Night** or **Key of Light**, depending on which type of Mimic you want to spawn.
- Use the key as if it were a consumable item to summon the Mimic instantly.
- **Note:** Using a **Key of Night** will randomly spawn either a **Corrupt Mimic** or a **Crimson Mimic**.

## Configuration
- **`RequireChest`** (Default: `true`) — Determines whether players must have at least one chest in their inventory to summon a Mimic.
- **`CooldownInSeconds`** (Default: `1`) — Sets the cooldown time (in seconds) before a player can spawn another Mimic.

## Installation
1. [Download the plugin `.dll` file from the Releases page](https://github.com/bbeeeeenn/MimicSpawnerV2/releases/).
2. Place the file in your TShock server’s `ServerPlugins` folder.
3. Restart your TShock server.
4. The plugin should now be active and ready to use.
